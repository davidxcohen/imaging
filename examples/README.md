# imaging examples
Examples can run using Jupyter notebook or from a python command line, `*.ipynb` or `*.py` respectively.

In both cases it is recommended to clone the repository

* __active_light_cw_photonics__ - Calculate the photonics of CW light. All of the input data is in one Excel table in `../data` folder
* __convolution_light_shutter_photonics__ - Calculates the convolution between light pulse to a short shutter.
* __geometrical_model_glint__ - Simulates the geometry of a light source reflkection by the cornea as capture in a 1D camera pixel
